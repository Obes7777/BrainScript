Welcome to brainScript

brainScript is a javaScript library that includes math operations, dom maniulation, string operations, and a more advanced date object


All of brainScript is compiled into one object "brain" which is then split into 4 sub-objects
    math

    string

    dom

    date


The math object
    The math object has 5 functions within it
    randomInt(min, max)
        enter the minimum and maximum numbers and it will return a integer (nt including decimals) bewtween the min and max

    randmonNum(min, max)
        simalar to randomInt function but the number returned will include decimals

    findHypotonuse(leg1, leg2)
        uses pythagreon theorem to find the hypotonuse of a right triangle, enter both legs and it will return the hypotonuse

    findLeg(leg, hypotonuse)
        uses pythagreon theorem to find the hypotonuse of a right triangle, enter the leg and hypotonuse and it will return the leg

    circleArea(radius)
        enter the radius of a circle and it will find the area of the circle

The string object
    The string object has 4 functions
    characterOfString(string, letterNum)
        enter the string and the letter of the string you want to find

    length(string)
        enter the string and it will return th e length

    stringContains(string, character)
        enter the string and the character or string that you want to check if the first string includes then it will return true or false

    letterOfStringIs(string, letterNum, character)
        checks if a specific letter (letterNum) in the string is the character then returns true or false

The dom object
    The dom object contains 6 functions
        changeText(id, string)
            changes the text based off the id you put in, both parameters are stringContains

        hide(id)
            hides the element based off the id you give, id parameter is a string

        show(id)
            shows the element based off the id you give, id parameter is a string

        click(id)
            clicks the element based off the id you give, id parameter is a string

        rotate(id, degree)
            rotates the element the degree amount, both parmeters are stringContains

        transparency(id, amount)
            makes the element transparent based off the amount you gave, both parameters are stringContains

The date object
    The date object in brainScript is the same as the built in date object that javaScript has
    while this date object does have 3 more functions than the built in object its main
    function is to save time with the built in object because you no longer have to declare a
    variable and add a constructor to get the date object
    !!the brainScript date object has slightly different syntax than the built in object to avoid confusion with the browser!!
    The date object has 12 functions 
        getFullDate()
            returns the full date as a string in the format of "dayOfWeekString, dayOfMonth, monthString, year"

        getDayOfWeekString()
            returns the day of the week as a string ("sunday", "monday", etc.)

        getMonthsString()
            return the month as a string ("January", "February", etc.)

        getYear()
            returns the year

        getMonthNum()
            returns the month as a number 0-11

        getDayOfMonth()
            returns the day of the month 1-31

        getHour()
            returns the hour 0-23

        getMinute()
            returns the minute 0-59

        getSecond()
            returns the second 0-59

        getMillisecond()
            returns the millisecond 0-999

        getDayOfWeekNum()
            returns the day of the week 0-6

        getCurrentTime()
            returns the milliseconds since January 1, 1970
