# BrainScript
A set of functions, objects, and classes that make coding in JavaScript easier and more user friendly

As an example the way to get a random number with min and max, 
Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) ) + min

To be made easier I made a basic function, 

function random(min, max){
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) ) + min
}

Beginner programmers can then import this file to whatever project their working on and can get used to coding in JavaScript
